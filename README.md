### Quick Overview ###

I needed a list of working proxies for one of my other projects, but I couldn't find any free ones.

`proxy_parser.py` parses proxies list from a sprecific site (which is not that good)

`proxy_parser_v2.py` parses proxies from lots of sites which increases the number of working proxies

Just run `main.py` and after a few minutes check generated `valid_proxy.txt`
